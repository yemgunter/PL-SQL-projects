Chapter 6 Functions Notes

The main difference between  functions and procedures is that a function is part of an expression. Unlike procedures, it  can’t serve as an entire statement. This difference is important because it means functions can be used in both SQL commands and PL/SQL statements. (Procedures can’t be used in  SQL statements.) 

The syntax for creating a function is much like the syntax for creating a procedure with  one important difference—a RETURN statement must be used to handle the value the  function is to return. This statement is included in both the function header and body  (executable sections of the block).


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name
	(parameter1_name mode data%TYPE,
	parameter2_name mode data%TYPE,
	.....)
	RETURN return_value_data type
IS|AS
	declaration section
BEGIN
	executable section
	RETURN variable_name;
EXCEPTION
	exception handlers
END;

Keep in mind that a function is part of an expression because the returned value needs to be held in a  variable, so it can’t be invoked in a stand-alone fashion, as with a procedure.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dollar_fmt_sf  
    (p_num NUMBER)  
    RETURN VARCHAR2  
IS  
    lv_amt_txt VARCHAR2(20);  
BEGIN  
    lv_amt_txt := TO_CHAR(p_num,'$99,999.99');  
    RETURN lv_amt_txt;  
END; 
/

--test the function w this anonymous block

DECLARE  
    lv_amt_num NUMBER(8,2) := 9999.55;  
BEGIN 
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(dollar_fmt_sf(lv_amt_num));  
END; 
/

--test the function with this SQL statement

SELECT dollar_fmt_sf(shipping), dollar_fmt_sf(total)  
FROM bb_basket  
WHERE idBasket = 3;

Assignment 6-2  Calculating a Shopper's Total Spending

Many of the reports generated from the system calculate the total dollars in a shopper’s  purchases. Follow these steps to create a function named TOT_PURCH_SF that accepts a  shopper ID as input and returns the total dollars the shopper has spent with Brewbean’s. Use the function in a SELECT statement that shows the shopper ID and total purchases for every  shopper in the database.  

1. Develop and run a CREATE FUNCTION statement to create the TOT_PURCH_SF function.  The function code needs a formal parameter for the shopper ID and to sum the TOTAL  column of the BB_BASKET table.  

2. Develop a SELECT statement, using the BB_SHOPPER table, to produce a list of each  shopper in the database and his or her total purchases.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tot_purch_sf
    (p_id NUMBER) 
    RETURN NUMBER --declares the data type of the return value
IS
    lv_tot_num NUMBER(8,2);
BEGIN
    SELECT SUM(total)
        INTO lv_tot_num
        FROM bb_basket
        WHERE idshopper = p_id;
    RETURN lv_tot_num;
END;

Assignment 6-3  Calculating a Shoppers Total Number of Orders

Another commonly used statistic in reports is the total number of orders a shopper has placed.  Follow these steps to create a function named NUM_PURCH_SF that accepts a shopper ID and  returns a shopper’s total number of orders. Use the function in a SELECT statement to display  the number of orders for shopper 23.  

1. Develop and run a CREATE FUNCTION statement to create the NUM_PURCH_SF function.  The function code needs to tally the number of orders (using an Oracle built-in function)  by shopper. Keep in mind that the ORDERPLACED column contains a 1 if an order has  been placed.  

2. Create a SELECT query by using the NUM_PURCH_SF function on the IDSHOPPER column  of the BB_SHOPPER table. Be sure to select only shopper 23. 

Casteel, Joan. Oracle 11g: PL/SQL Programming (p. 245). Cengage Textbook. Kindle Edition. 

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION num_purch_sf
    (p_id NUMBER)
    RETURN NUMBER 
IS
    lv_tot_num NUMBER(5); --declare a variable to hold return value
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(idbasket) --Oracle built-in function for tally
        INTO lv_tot_num
        FROM bb_basket
        WHERE idshopper = p_id
            AND orderplaced = 1;
    RETURN lv_tot_num;
END;
/

--use this SQL query to test out the function using only shopper 23
SELECT num_purch_sf(idshopper) 
FROM bb_shopper
WHERE idshopper = 23;

Assignment 6-4  Identifying the Weekday for an Order Date

The day of the week that baskets are created is often analyzed to determine consumer shopping patterns. Create a function named DAY_ORD_SF that accepts an order date and  returns the weekday. Use the function in a SELECT statement to display each basket ID and the  weekday the order was created. Write a second SELECT statement, using this function to  display the total number of orders for each weekday. (Hint: Call the TO_CHAR function to retrieve  the weekday from a date.)  

1. Develop and run a CREATE FUNCTION statement to create the DAY_ORD_SF function. Use  the DTCREATED column of the BB_BASKET table as the date the basket is created. Call  the TO_CHAR function with the DAY option to retrieve the weekday for a date value.  

2. Create a SELECT statement that lists the basket ID and weekday for every basket.  

3. Create a SELECT statement, using a GROUP BY clause to list the total number of baskets  per weekday. Based on the results, what’s the most popular shopping day? 

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION day_ord_sf
    (p_daycreated bb_basket.dtcreated%TYPE)
    RETURN VARCHAR2  --declares the data type of the return value weekday
IS
    lv_weekday VARCHAR2(10); --declare a variable to hold return value weekday
BEGIN
    lv_weekday := TO_CHAR(p_daycreated, 'DAY'); --use TO_CHAR to format weekday
    RETURN lv_weekday;
END;
/


Column idbasket Heading 'Basket ID' Format 99999;
Column day_ord_sf(dtcreated) Heading 'Weekday Created' Format A15;

SELECT idbasket, day_ord_sf(dtcreated)
FROM bb_basket;

SELECT day_ord_sf(dtcreated)AS WEEKDAY, COUNT(idbasket) AS "TOTAL ORDERS"
FROM bb_basket
GROUP BY day_ord_sf(dtcreated)

Assignment 6-5 Calculating Days Between Ordering and Shipping

An analyst in the quality assurance office reviews the time elapsed between receiving an order  and shipping the order. 

Any orders that haven’t been shipped within a day of the order being  placed are investigated. 

Create a function named ORD_SHIP_SF that calculates the number of  days between the basket’s creation date and the shipping date. 

The function should return a  character string that states OK if the order was shipped within a day or CHECK if it wasn’t. 

If the  order hasn’t shipped, return the string Not shipped. 

The IDSTAGE column of the  BB_BASKETSTATUS table indicates a shipped item with the value 5, and the DTSTAGE column is the shipping date. 

The DTORDERED column of the BB_BASKET table is the order  date. 

Review data in the BB_BASKETSTATUS table, and create an anonymous block to test all  three outcomes the function should handle. 


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ord_ship_sf
  (p_basket_id bb_basketstatus.idbasket%TYPE)
  RETURN VARCHAR2 
IS
  lv_ship_date bb_basketstatus.dtstage%TYPE;
  lv_order_date bb_basket.dtordered%TYPE;
BEGIN
  SELECT s.dtstage, b.dtordered
    INTO lv_ship_date, lv_order_date
  FROM bb_basketstatus s
    NATURAL JOIN bb_basket b
  WHERE idbasket = basket_id
    AND idstage = 5; -- Only retrieve orders shipped
    
  -- Check shipping status based on data and date differences
  IF lv_ship_date IS NULL OR lv_order_date IS NULL THEN
    RETURN 'Not Shipped';
  ELSIF (lv_ship_date - lv_order_date > 1) THEN
    RETURN 'CHECK'; -- For more than one day to ship
  ELSE
    RETURN 'OK'; -- For one day or less to ship
  END IF;

EXCEPTION
  WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
    RETURN 'Not Shipped'; -- For when no data is found
END;
/

DECLARE
    basket_id NUMBER := 3; --variable for assigned Basket ID
    result VARCHAR2(20); --variable for function results
BEGIN
  result := ord_ship_sf(basket_id); --call function and store result 
    
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Basket ID: ' || basket_id || 'status is: ' || result);
END;

DECLARE
    basket_id NUMBER := 4; --variable for assigned Basket ID
    result VARCHAR2(20); --variable for function results

Assignment 6-6 Adding Descriptions for Order Status Codes

When a shopper returns to the Web site to check an order’s status, information from the  BB_BASKETSTATUS table is displayed. However, only the status code is available in the  BB_BASKETSTATUS table, not the status description.

Create a function named STATUS_DESC_SF  that accepts a stage ID and returns the status description. 

The descriptions for stage IDs  are listed in Table 6-3. 

Test the function in a SELECT statement that retrieves all rows in the  BB_BASKETSTATUS table for basket 4 and displays the stage ID and its description. 


Table 6-3 Basket Stage Descriptions:
Stage 	ID Description  
1 	Order submitted  
2 	Accepted, sent to shipping  
3 	Back-ordered  
4 	Cancelled  
5 	Shipped


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION status_desc_sf
    (p_stage_id bb_basketstatus.idstage%TYPE)
    RETURN VARCHAR2
IS
    stage_descrip VARCHAR2(30); -- variable for stage id description
BEGIN
    CASE p_stage_id
        WHEN 1 THEN stage_descrip := 'Order Submitted';
        WHEN 2 THEN stage_descrip := 'Accepted, sent to shipping';
        WHEN 3 THEN stage_descrip := 'Back-ordered';
        WHEN 4 THEN stage_descrip := 'Cancelled';
        WHEN 5 THEN stage_descrip := 'Shipped';
        ELSE stage_descrip := 'No info on order'; -- if no stage id for order
    END CASE;
    
    RETURN stage_descrip; -- return stage description
END; 
/

SELECT idstage, status_desc_sf(idstage)
FROM bb_basketstatus
WHERE idbasket = 4;

Assignment 6-7 Calculating an Order's Tax Amount


Create a function named TAX_CALC_SF that accepts a basket ID, calculates the tax amount  by using the basket subtotal, and returns the correct tax amount for the order. 

The tax is  determined by the shipping state, which is stored in the BB_BASKET table. 

The BB_TAX table  contains the tax rate for states that require taxes on Internet purchases. 

If the state isn’t listed  in the tax table or no shipping state is assigned to the basket, a tax amount of zero should be  applied to the order. 

Use the function in one SELECT statement that (A) displays the shipping costs for  a basket that has tax applied and (B) displays a basket with no shipping state.
