4. composite variables -  variables that can hold multiple pieces of information at once. 

5. variable initialization - giving a variable its first value when you declare it. 

6. control structures - road signs for a program, helping it decide what action to take next.

7. decision structures - parts of a program that make choices based on certain conditions like asking “if this is true, do this; if not, do something else.”

8. looping constructs - parts of a program that repeat a set of instructions over and over again until you tell it to stop.

9. basic loops - simple instructions in a program that tell it to repeat a set of steps a certain number of times or until a condition is met.
